# Techdegree-Unit7-project
 
For this project, I used the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app will be built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

I learned about some of the best practices of working with React, like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in your JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. Additionally, I now have practice working with React supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.

I changed the css fonts from default to a color pallate of purples and pinks.
